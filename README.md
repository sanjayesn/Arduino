# Introduction
This repository contains a series of simple Arduino Uno projects, along with their circuit diagrams. A more detailed explanation about each separate project can be found below.

## Blinking LED
This is the quintessential Arduino starter project. It makes an LED blink on and off every .5 seconds.

### Materials
* 1 3V LED
* 1 270 Ohm Resistor

## Button LED
This project allows you to control an LED using a push button. Here a pulldown resistor is needed. We also used the Button library available [here](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Button)

### Materials
* 1 3V LED
* 1 Push Button
* 1 270 Ohm Resistor
* 1 10K Ohm Resistor

## Remote LED
This project allows you to control an LED using an infrared remote and a receiver. We used the IR library available [here](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote)
